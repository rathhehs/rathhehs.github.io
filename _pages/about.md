About me
======

My name is Houshi He, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering Mathematics and Computational Science at Chalmers University of Technology (09/2024-06/2026). 

I enjoy mathematics but prefer its practical applications over purely theoretical aspects. Statistics fascinates me as it allows me to use mathematical tools to solve real-world problems, which I find incredibly rewarding. 

I am particularly interested in the intersection of statistics with other fields, such as AI/ML in computer science and biostatistics in biology. I've worked on related projects through internships and research, and my focus remains firmly rooted in statistics.


Other Information
======
I am a passionate traveler and sports enthusiast, deeply in love with football. I love football, and I love every football club, but most of all, I support my hometown team Tianjin Teda and the Chinese National Team.
