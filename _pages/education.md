Projects
======
**The Causal Effect Analysis of Emotional States and Sicca Syndrome**

• Evaluated the potential causal relationship between sicca syndrome and emotional states using GWAS data.\
• Used R language to apply five Mendelian randomization methods, establishing causal relationships between
schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sicca syndrome, with p-values below 0.05.\
• Confirmed the robustness of results through tests for heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and sensitivity analyses, providing new insights into the connection between emotional states and sicca syndrome.

**Bayesian Estimation of Covariance Matrices Using Aggregate Data**

• Collected aggregate data from tests of different medications for similar symptoms; employed Bayesian hierarchical modeling to unveil correlations between indicators, such as age and height.\
• Utilized the inverse Wishart distribution as the prior distribution for Σ, ensuring conjugacy in Bayesian statistics, facilitating the derivation of the posterior distribution form, and simplifying the computation of Bayesian inference.\
• Derived the likelihood function based on the prior distribution and available information.

**Application of Propensity Score Matching for Intervention Effects Estimating**

• Selected confounding variables and extracted 2,000,000+ data by SQL; cleaned and processed data in Python.\
• Applied logistic regression to calculate propensity score and predict exposure probability to create virtual control groups.\
• Matched experimental groups and control groups; applied bucket matching to improve matching efficiency.\
• Calculated the average treatment effect of exposure on the return rate of churned users.
