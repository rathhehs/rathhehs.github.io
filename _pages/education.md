Projects
======
**Bayesian Estimation of Covariance Matrices Using Aggregate Data**

• Collected aggregate data from tests of different medications for similar symptoms; employed Bayesian hierarchical modeling to unveil correlations between indicators, such as age and height.\
• Utilized the inverse Wishart distribution as the prior distribution for Σ, ensuring conjugacy in Bayesian statistics,
facilitating the derivation of the posterior distribution form, and simplifying the computation of Bayesian inference.\
• Derived the likelihood function based on the prior distribution and available information.

**Application of Machine Learning for Auto Insurance Pricing**

• Collected and analyzed auto insurance claims data, incorporating factors such as the driver’s age, car age, brand, etc.\
• Cleaned raw data to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis.\
• Applied various ML methods including logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, decision trees and K-NN for
predicting claim occurrences; assessed and compared the performance of these models.\
• Dealt with 500,000+ data; utilized various data science libraries, including Scikit-learn, NumPy and Pandas data frames.

**Application of Propensity Score Matching for Intervention Effects Estimating**

• Selected confounding variables and extracted 2,000,000+ data by SQL; cleaned and processed data in Python.\
• Applied logistic regression to calculate propensity score and predict exposure probability to create virtual control groups.\
• Matched experimental groups and control groups; applied bucket matching to improve matching efficiency.\
• Calculated the average treatment effect of exposure on the return rate of churned users.
